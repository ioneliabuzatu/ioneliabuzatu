Currently, I am a Lead AI Scientist at [Pi School](https://twitter.com/picampusschool). I have been working in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the last 5 years after a Ph.D. in Theoretical Particle\Statistical Physics ([SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/)). Particularly, I am applying Deep Learning and mostly Natural Language Processing (NLP) to solve problems that have a positive social or environmental impact (AI4Good). More in general I have a strong interest in AI research and Quantum Machine Learning, which is the common ground of my past and present. 

I am a Machine Learning lecturer at the [Master in HPC](https://twitter.com/mhpc_sissa_ictp) and at Bicocca University. By the way, I am a [TED❌ speaker](https://youtu.be/8-hrmer9d_E), a civil pilot, and I enjoy adventures (here my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/denocris/)). 

🌱 My last work? NLP for Sustainability in collaboration with European JRC, check it out [here](https://picampus-school.com/circular-economy-patents4ippc-the-tool-for-zero-pollution/)
